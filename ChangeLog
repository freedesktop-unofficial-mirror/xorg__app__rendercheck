	* TODO:
	* tests.c: (get_pixel), (fill_test), (destcoords_test),
	(begin_test):
	- get_pixel was not at fault, and get destcoords_test working.
	- Change fill_test from being a duplication of the blend tests
	  to a test of whether the XRenderFillRectangle()s produced the
	  expected results.
	- Update TODO list.
	- Bump version to 1.0.1.
