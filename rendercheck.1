.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rendercheck
is a set of simple tests of the X Render extension.  It is designed for authors
of Render implementations in X Servers.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d|\-\-display\ display
Specifies the display to test against.
.TP
.BI \-i|\-\-iter\ iterations
Specifies the number of times to repeat each operation before sampling results.
Some X Servers may behave differently (hardware vs software rendering paths)
depending on the previous operations done, so this may be used to influence the
server's choices.
.TP
.BI \-\-sync
Enables synchronous xlib operation, for debugging.
.TP
.BI \-t|\-\-tests\ test1,test2,test3...
Enables only a specific subset of the possible tests.  Test names include 
fill, dcoords, scoords, mcoords, tscoords, tmcoords, blend, composite,
cacomposite, gradients, repeat, and triangles.  Names must be separated by
commas and have no spaces.
.TP
.BI \-v|\-\-verbose
Enables verbose printing of information on tests run, and successes and
failures.
.SH BUGS
Several limitations are documented in the TODO file accompanying the source.
